# Music-Crime-Happiness

## About

For the [final project for my Statistical Graphics and Data Visualization course](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/aluby1/stat041/Projects/final-proj.html), I worked with [Tolga Atabas](https://github.com/tatabas). We looked at correlations between happiness of music and world happiness, as well as relationships between explicit music and crime rates over time. Though we did not find strong relationships between the two, we made many, many interesting visualizations of the data sets and variables.
